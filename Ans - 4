To determine if n new flowers can be planted in the given flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, we can iterate over the flowerbed and check each plot to see if it is empty and its adjacent plots are also empty. If this condition is met for any plot, we can plant a flower and decrement n by 1. We repeat this process until n becomes 0 or we reach the end of the flowerbed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of flowers planted.

2. Iterate over the indices i in the range from 0 to the length of the flowerbed array.

3. Check if the current plot at index i is empty (flowerbed[i] == 0).

4. If the current plot is empty, check its adjacent plots to ensure they are also empty or out of bounds.

5. If i - 1 is out of bounds or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0.
6. If i + 1 is out of bounds or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0.
7. If both conditions are met, plant a flower by setting flowerbed[i] = 1 and increment count by 1.

8. If count becomes equal to n, return True to indicate that n new flowers can be planted.

9. After the loop finishes, if count is less than n, return False as it's not possible to plant n new flowers.

Here's the implementation in Python:


def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
        if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
            flowerbed[i] = 1
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return True
    return False
Let's test the function with the given example:


flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 1
result = canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n)
print(result)  # Output: True
The function returns True, which is the correct output for the given example. It is possible to plant 1 new flower in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
