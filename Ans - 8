To find the minimum score of the given array nums after applying the operation at most once for each index, we can take the following steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the nums array.

2. If the difference between the minimum and maximum values is less than or equal to 2 * k, return 0 as no operations are needed. The score will be 0.

3. Otherwise, calculate the mid-point value as (minimum + maximum) // 2.

4. Iterate over each element in the nums array and perform the following steps:

5. If the element is less than or equal to the mid-point value, increase it by k.
6. If the element is greater than the mid-point value, decrease it by k.
7. Find the new minimum and maximum values in the modified nums array.

8. Return the difference between the new maximum and minimum values as the minimum score.

Here's the implementation in Python:


def minimumScore(nums, k):
    minimum = min(nums)
    maximum = max(nums)

    if maximum - minimum <= 2 * k:
        return 0

    mid = (minimum + maximum) // 2

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] <= mid:
            nums[i] += k
        else:
            nums[i] -= k

    new_minimum = min(nums)
    new_maximum = max(nums)

    return new_maximum - new_minimum
Let's test the function with the given example:


nums = [1]
k = 0
result = minimumScore(nums, k)
print(result)  # Output: 0
The function returns 0, which is the correct output for the given example. The score is 0 because there is only one element in the nums array, and no operations are needed to make the difference between the maximum and minimum values 0.
